Iterative control statements
                               (or)
                         Repetative control statements
                               (or)
                            Loops
                --------------------------------- 

what is loop?

===> A single statement or group of statements are executed repeatedly
     This process is called a loop.


     ex-1:

                         condition      live or not?  yes True
                  5:00 wakeup
                  6:00 personel works 
                  7:00 tea/coffee 
                  8:00 break fast
                  9:00 goto office
                  10
                  11
                  12
                  1
                  2
                  3
                  4
                  5
                  6
                  7
                  8:00 dinner
                  9:00 sleep



        ex-2:
                        class-1
                        class-2
                        class-3
                        break
                        class-4
                        class-5





===> python supports 2 types of Loops. These are:
                  1. while loop
                  2. for loop
                  

1. while loop:
----------------
===> A single statement or group of statements are executed repeatedly
     until condition returns True.
===> If the condition returns False, then, to stop the loop.

==> syntax:
    
                 while condition:
                     st-1
                     st-2
                     st-3
                     --
                     --
                     st-n



          Here,
                ===> while is a  keyword.
                ===>  condition returns either True / False 
                ===>  ':' is called begining of the loop.
                ===>   st-1,st-2,st-3,......st-n are called a loop.



ex-1: write a program to print Good Morning  To All message 10 times  
method-1: without while loop 

print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')
print('Good Morning  To All')


                     





method-2: using repetition operator  

print('Good Morning  To All\n'*10)


method-3: using while loop  

i = 1                                             
while i<=5:   
    print('Good Morning  To All')
    i=i+1

  

ex-2: write a program to print 1 to 10 numbers   
i = 1                                             
while i<=10:   
    print(i)
    i=i+1


ex-3: write a program to print odd numbers between 1 to 10 numbers   
i = 1                                             
while i<=10:   
    print(i)
    i=i+2



ex-4: write a program to print even numbers between 1 to 10 numbers   
i = 2                                             
while i<=10:   
    print(i)
    i=i+2



ex-5: write a program to print  numbers between 10 to 1 numbers  
i = 10                                            
while i>=1:   
    print(i)
    i=i-1
 
    

ex-6:        
i = 1                                                                       
while i<=10:   
    print(i)
    i=i+1              




          Here,
          i=1  , control variable value is initialized to 1
          i<=10, is called condition
          i=i+1  is called , the control variable value is increased  by 1.








ex-7:        
                                                                   
while i<=10:   
    print(i)
    i=i+1              


    Note:
        it returns NameError





ex-8:        
i = 1                                                                  
while  :   
    print(i)
    i=i+1              



    Note:
        it returns SyntaxError



ex-9:  
i = 1
while i<=10:   
    print(i)
                 


      Note:
          The above is executed inifinit No. of times.
          Because, i value is always 1.

ex-10:  
i = 25
while i<=50:
    print(i)
    i=i+10
    

ex-11:    
i = 1
while i<=10:
    print('Inside while i value  =  ' ,i)
    i=i+1
else:
    print('Inside Else i value  =  ' ,i)
