String Slicing — it’s like cutting cake 🍰 in Python, but way more powerful and calorie-free 😄.

Let’s slice it clean and clear.

🔪 What is String Slicing?

String slicing is the process of extracting a part of a string using a special syntax.

Python strings are like arrays of characters — you can use indexes to get individual characters or ranges.

🧠 Syntax of String Slicing:

string[start : end : step]
Part	Meaning
start	Index where the slice begins
end	Index where the slice stops (but not included)
step	Optional. How many steps to skip
💡 Quick Example:

text = "DataEngineering"

print(text[0:4])     # Output: 'Data'
print(text[4:7])     # Output: 'Eng'
print(text[:4])      # Output: 'Data' (start is optional)
print(text[4:])      # Output: 'Engineering' (end is optional)
print(text[::2])     # Output: 'Dtagnieig' (every 2nd char)
print(text[::-1])    # Output: 'gnireenignEataD' (reverse string)
📌 Indexing Reminder:

Python uses zero-based indexing, and supports negative indexes too.

s = "Python"
# Indexes:  P  y  t  h  o  n
#           0  1  2  3  4  5
#          -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
print(s[-1])    # Output: 'n'
print(s[-3:-1]) # Output: 'ho'
✅ Real-World Uses:

Extract first name from full name
name = "Guru Mohan"
print(name[:4])  # Output: 'Guru'
Reverse a string
text = "Data"
print(text[::-1])  # Output: 'ataD'
Get file extension
filename = "report.csv"
print(filename[-3:])  # Output: 'csv'
🚫 Common Mistakes:

Slicing doesn’t include the end index (it's exclusive).
s = "Python"
print(s[0:2])  # Outputs: 'Py', not 'Pyt'
If start > end with a positive step, you get an empty string.
print(s[5:1])  # Output: ''
🧁 Final Bite:

Slicing makes Python clean, fast, and powerful when working with strings.
