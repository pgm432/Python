programs using list data structure
        -------------------------------------------

1. write a program to create a empty list
method-1:  
x = [  ]
print(x)
print(type(x))



method-2  
x = list()
print(x)
print(type(x))



2. To create a list with values  
method-1: staic  
x = [11,22,33,44,55,66]
print(x)


method-2: dynamic , using eval   
x = eval(input('Enter your elements'))
print(x)


method-3: dynamic , using append()    
List1 =  [   ]
n = int(input('How many stored into a list'))
for i in range(1,n+1,1):    
    y = int(input('Enter your element'))
    List1.append(y)


 
print(List1)



3. write a program to display the following output  
            sample input:
                List1 = [ 11,22,33,44,55,66]

            output:
                evenlist = [22,44,66]
                oddlist  = [11,33,55]     


List1 = [ 11,22,33,44,55,66]
evenlist = [  ]
oddlist = [  ]
for i in List1:   
    if i%2==0:
        evenlist.append(i)
    else:
        oddlist.append(i)


print(f'even List  =  {evenlist}')
print(f'Odd List  =   {oddlist}')


 



4. write a program to display the following output   
            sample input:
                List1 = [ 9,-4,-8,23,45,-22,-11]

            output:
                poslist = [9,23,45]
                oddlist  = [-4,-8,-22,-11]    


List1 = [ 9,-4,-8,23,45,-22,-11]
poslist = [  ]
neglist = [  ]
for i in List1:   
    if i>0:
        poslist.append(i)
    else:
        neglist.append(i)


print(f'Positive Numbers  List  =  {poslist}')
print(f'Negative List  =   {neglist}')


 


5. write a program to count No. of elements in a given list 
method-1: using len() function 

List1 =  [ 9,4,8,45,23]
print(f'No. of Elements  =  {len(List1)}')


method-2: without using len() function  

List1 = [ 9,4,8,45,23]
count = 0

for i in List1: # 9   4   8   45   23
    count=count+1
    




print(f'No. of Elements  =  {count}')

 


6. write a program to find sum of list elements  
method-1: using sum() function 

List1 =  [ 9,4,8,45,23]
print(f'sum  of List Elements  =  {sum(List1)}')

 
method-2: without using sum() function    

List1 = [ 9,4,8,45,23]
s = 0

for i in List1: # 9   4   8   45   23
    s = s+i
                             
                                 


print(f'sum  of List Elements  =  {s}')
 
 

7. write a program to find lowest value in a given list
8. write a program to find highest value in a given list  



9. write a program to arrange list elements in reverse order   
method-1: using reverse() function   
List1 = [ 9,4,8,45,23]
print(f'Original List  = {List1}')
List1.reverse()
print(f'Reverse List  = {List1}')


method-2: using slicing  
List1 = [ 9,4,8,45,23]
print(f'Original List  = {List1}')
 
print(f'Reverse List  = {List1[ : : -1]}')


method-3: using slicing  
List1 = [ 9,4,8,45,23]
print(f'Original List  = {List1}')
 
print(f'Reverse List  = {List1[ -1 : : -1]}')



method-4: using for loop   
List1 = [ 9,4,8,45,23]
revlist =  [  ]
for i in range(-1,-len(List1)-1,-1 ):   
    revlist.append(List1[i]) 



print(f'Original List  = {List1}') 
print(f'Reverse List  = {revlist}')
