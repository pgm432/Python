===============================
 1. Which of the following is the correct syntax for an if statement in Python?
a) if condition then:
b) if condition:
c) if condition do:
d) if: condition
2. What will the following code print?
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Greater")
else:
    print("Smaller")
a) Greater                         b) Smaller                   c) Error           d) None of the above
3. How many times will the following code print "Hello"?
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("Hello")
    i += 1
    
a) 0 times                      b) 1 time                     c) 2 times         d) 3 times



4. What will be the output of the following code?
for i in range(5, 1, -1):
    print(i)
    
a) 5 4 3 2                   b) 5 4 3 2 1                      c) 4 3 2 1          d) 5 4 3
5. Which of the following is the correct syntax to create an infinite while loop?
a) while True:                                      b) while(1):
c) while 1 == 1:                                   d) All of the above
6. Write a Python program using an if statement
   that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

7. Write a Python program that prints all even numbers  
between 1 and 20 using a for loop.
8. Write a Python program that sums all numbers
   between 1 and 50 using a while loop and prints the result.
9. Write a program that prints the factorial of a number using a for loop.
   (Use input() to take the number from the user.)
10. What will be the output of the following code?
x = 0
while x < 5:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")
    x += 1
 

   
 
11. Write a Python program using a for loop to print the following pattern:
1
12
123
1234
12345

12. Write a Python program using a while loop
   that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

13. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of the digits of a number
  using a while loop. 
For example, for the number 123, the program should return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
14. Write a Python program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms using a while loop, where n is given by the user.
15. Create a program that asks the user to enter an integer, then uses a while loop to reverse the digits of the number. For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 4321.
